# A Pok√©mon Sprite library and Tradelist template

spreadsheetsprites is a Pokemon tradelist template for everyone to use. The main purpose of these templates is to be able to show other people what you have to offer without having to take photos or having to type it out over and over.

The template can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_deJ-nWnclxL7HeLTlFppfvewciEmmaxA3WKCtmLJy0/edit#gid=150229614). It is created for Google Spreadsheets.

All instructions can be found on the 'How to Use' tab on the template, and additional instructions can be found on the [release thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonPlaza/comments/5hwsxo/free_spreadsheets_all_updated_for_sun_and_moon/) on reddit.

As of Version 2.0, you can use the Box Data Report funtion from kwsch's [PKHeX](https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX) to easily export your precious Pokemon into this spreadsheet.

## Story
spreadsheetsprites started as a personal project where I wanted to create a colorful tradelist to use on Pokemon trading subreddits, mainly [/r/PokemonPlaza](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonPlaza/). 

After receiving a ton of positive feedback, I decided to create a version anyone could use, and Version 1.0 was born. This was a fairly limited version, but it was enough for most people.

Over time, I kept improving my personal tradelist to learn and test features, but I rarely modified the template. However, with the release of Pokemon Sun and Moon in November, I combined all that I had learned in the months before to create a new template, Version 2.0, with improved functionality, support for the new games and a way to import your Pokemon into your tradelist with PKHeX.
